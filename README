# CUDA Vector Addition

This project demonstrates a simple CUDA application that performs vector addition. It includes both host and device code to add two vectors element-wise using CUDA.

## Overview

The CUDA vector addition project demonstrates the following concepts:
- Writing a CUDA kernel to perform parallel computations.
- Allocating and deallocating memory on the GPU.
- Copying data between host and device memory.
- Launching CUDA kernels with appropriate grid and block dimensions.

## Files

- `vector_add.cu`: The main CUDA source file containing the vector addition kernel and the host code.

## Prerequisites

- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA Compute Capability
- CUDA Toolkit (vX.X or later) installed
- NVIDIA drivers compatible with your CUDA Toolkit version

## Compilation

1. Ensure you have the CUDA Toolkit installed and the `nvcc` compiler is available in your system's PATH.

2. Navigate to the directory containing `vector_add.cu`.

3. Compile the CUDA code using the following command:

   ```sh
   nvcc -o vector_add vector_add.cu
